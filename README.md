## Sales Data Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing 12 months of sales data from an electronics store, featuring hundreds of thousands of transactions. The dataset includes detailed information such as the month of purchase, product type, cost, and purchase address. Our objective is to clean the data, explore it, and answer five high-level business questions to derive actionable insights.

# Data Cleaning
The first step in our analysis involves preparing the data for exploration. 

This entails:
Removing duplicates: Ensuring each transaction is unique to prevent skewed analysis.
Handling missing values: Filling in or removing any records with incomplete information.
Data type conversion: Ensuring that dates, numbers, and categorical data are in the correct format for analysis.
Standardizing values: Normalizing product names and addresses for consistency.

# Data Exploration
With clean data, we proceed to explore it through various angles using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization. Our exploration is structured around answering five high-level business questions. 

# Conclusion
This project not only answers critical business questions that can guide strategic decisions but also showcases the power of data analysis tools like pandas and matplotlib in extracting insights from complex datasets. Through thorough data cleaning, detailed exploration, and strategic analysis, we provide valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.
